## Every front-end dev should have a CSS starter/reset kit, so here's mine

Inspired by the likes of [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/links/the-coyier-css-starter/), [Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/the-coyier-css-starter/), and especially [Mike Mai's throwdown](https://mikemai.net/blog/2024/11/01/you-are-not-a-css-dev-if-you-have-not-made-a-css-reset.html), I decided to finally create a base CSS "starter" file of all the stuff I commonly use and should probably use in future projects. You're welcome to use it or not. I also wrote a [blog post about it here](https://markkimmerle.com/blog/posts/2025/10/my-custom-css-reset/).
